# Write a simple contract and declare four different types of variables. Write get and set functions for each of these variables. Return the value of the variable in the “set function”.**
 # This is a simple contract that declares four different types of variables - uint, bool, address and string. 
 # It also has get and set functions for each of these variables.
# The set functions first update the value of the variable and then return the new value. 
# The get functions simply return the current value of the variables.
# Note that the 'myString' variable is declared as 'constant', which means its value cannot be changed after it is initialized.
